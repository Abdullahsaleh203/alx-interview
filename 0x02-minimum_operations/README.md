# 0x02-minimum_operations

### 0\.Minimum Operations
In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

Prototype: def minOperations(n)
Returns an integer
If n is impossible to achieve, return 0
#### Example:

n = 9

H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste =>HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH

Number of operations: 6

```py
carrie@ubuntu:~/0x02-minoperations$ cat 0-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""
Main file for testing
"""

minOperations = __import__('0-minoperations').minOperations

n = 4
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

n = 12
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

carrie@ubuntu:~/0x02-minoperations$
```
```py
carrie@ubuntu:~/0x02-minoperations$ ./0-main.py
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7
